# Now lets say you remove a package with -d (--nodeps), and after a time
# you decide to install that package again. There could be packages that
# depend on the one you install, but they will not have a required field
# in the package database. Why is this an option (is should be default),
# its because this takes a lot of time (from 15to 30 seconds on a system
# with 500 installed packages), so only enable this if you have time :/
# NOTE: this will be changed in 0.1.6 (each package will have its own
# directory).
