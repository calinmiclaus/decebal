# /etc/suauth   This file contains the detailed su control
#               settings. It can change the behaviour of the 
#               su command, based upon:
#                
#               1) the user su is targetting
#               2) the user executing the su command (or any 
#		groups he might  be a member of)
#
#               See suauth(5) for more information.
