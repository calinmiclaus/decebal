This direcory contains the system initialization scripts
used on Decebal Linux 0.9.0 (alpha). Still in the early
stage of development so dont expect to much.

Features:
  - dependencies and conflicts
  - new initialization type (combined sysvinit and bsdinit)
  - initialization methond (colors, simple..) on the fly
  - not bloated :/

Bugs, ideas...and everything else goes to slider@decebal.org.
